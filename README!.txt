Welcome to the Inheritence Tutorial!
Prerequesites: Classes

Inheritence allows for one class to inherit variables and
functions from another class. For example, you can have 
classes "Bike" and "Car" that inherit variables and functions
from "Vehicle" class. 

In the next tutorial "virtual functions",  you will see classes
like fighter, wizard, necromancer, that inherit from 
the "character" class
